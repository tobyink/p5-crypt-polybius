=head1 NAME

Crypt::Role::GreekAlphabet - twenty-four letter Greek alphabet for classic cryptography

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides a twenty-four letter alphabet for use in classic
cryptography. The letters are all uppercase.

=head2 Object Methods

=over

=item C<< alphabet >>

Returns the alphabet as an arrayref of letters.

=item C<< preprocess($str) >>

Perform pre-encipher processing on a string. The string is uppercased.
Common Unicode codepoints corresponding to Greek letters with diacritics
are replaced with the closest match from the alphabet.

Punctuation characters, spaces, etc are I<not> removed from the string.
It is the choice of the cipher whether to, say, pass them through
unchanged, or strip them from the ciphertext.
