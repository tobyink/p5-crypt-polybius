=head1 NAME

Crypt::Role::LatinAlphabet - twenty-five letter Latin alphabet for classic cryptography

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role provides a twenty-five letter alphabet (does not include J)
for use in classic cryptography. The letters are all uppercase.

=head2 Object Methods

=over

=item C<< alphabet >>

Returns the alphabet as an arrayref of letters.

=item C<< preprocess($str) >>

Perform pre-encipher processing on a string. The string is uppercased;
non-ASCII characters are replaced with ASCII equivalents; the letter
B<J> is replaced with B<I>.

Punctuation characters, spaces, etc are I<not> removed from the string.
It is the choice of the cipher whether to, say, pass them through
unchanged, or strip them from the ciphertext.
