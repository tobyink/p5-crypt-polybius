Crypt::Polybius - implementation of the Polybius square

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Crypt::Polybius;
   
   #      1    2    3    4    5
   # 1    A    B    C    D    E
   # 2    F    G    H    I/J  K
   # 3    L    M    N    O    P
   # 4    Q    R    S    T    U
   # 5    V    W    X    Y    Z
   #
   # ATTACK  ->  11 44 44 11 13 25
   # AT      ->  11 44
   # DAWN    ->  14 11 52 33

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an object-oriented implementation of the
B<Polybius square>, or B<Polybius checkerboard>. This cipher is
not cryptographically strong, nor completely round-trip-safe.

=head2 Roles

This class performs the following roles:

=over

=item *

L<Crypt::Role::LatinAlphabet>

=item *

L<Crypt::Role::CheckerboardCipher>

=item *

L<MooX::Traits>

=back

=head2 Constructor

=over

=item C<< new >>

Moose-like constructor.

=back

=head2 Attributes

The following attributes exist. All of them have defaults, and should
not be provided to the constructor.

=over

=item C<< square >>

An array of arrays of letters. Provided by
L<Crypt::Role::CheckerboardCipher>.

=item C<< square_size >>

The length of one side of the square, as an integer. Provided by
L<Crypt::Role::CheckerboardCipher>.

=item C<< encipher_hash >>

Hashref used by the C<encipher> method. Provided by
L<Crypt::Role::CheckerboardCipher>.

=item C<< decipher_hash >>

Hashref used by the C<decipher> method. Provided by
L<Crypt::Role::CheckerboardCipher>.

=head2 Methods

=over

=item C<< encipher($str) >>

Enciphers a string and returns the ciphertext. Provided by
L<Crypt::Role::CheckerboardCipher>.

=item C<< decipher($str) >>

Deciphers a string and returns the plaintext. Provided by
L<Crypt::Role::CheckerboardCipher>.

=item C<< preprocess($str) >>

Perform pre-encipher processing on a string. C<encipher> calls this, so
you are unlikely to need to call it yourself.

The implementation in this class uppercases any lower-case letters, and
passes the string through Text::Unidecode. It also replaces any letter
B<J> with B<I> because the former is not found in the alphabet provided
by L<Crypt::Role::LatinAlphabet>;

=back
